            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The chest or pectorals are one of the key muscle groups of the human body. 
                This muscle group is used in mainly "pushing movements", or movements that 
                involve exerting force in front of oneself. The effort of growing one's 
                chest can usually lead to muscle gains in other areas due to the pushing 
                movement involving other muscles like triceps and core. There are a plethora
                of effecient chest exercises that can help you grow chest substantially.

            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            <p>
                The chest muscles are actually layered, and the layers stretch in different 
                directions. This means different movements can target different parts of your
                chest. Two main movements follow an "outward" motion and an "inward-outward" 
                motion, so the exercises follow these patterns. These different chest exercises 
                include:
